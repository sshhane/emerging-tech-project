    "## How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using the package [Keras](https://keras.io) to load the MNIST dataset and to build the models with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Keras?\n",
    "Keras is a deep learning library for python which provides an easy to use suit of modules.  It provides an easy and efficient way of loading the MNIST data and also a very user-friendly way of creating neural networks \n",
    "From the [Keras](https://keras.io) website:\n",
    ">Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Tensorflow?\n",
    "From their [about page](https://www.tensorflow.org):\n",
    ">TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular uses for Tensorflow is machine learning, more info on this can be found on the [Tensorflow Keras tutorials page](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/)\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "<img src=\"img/neuralNet.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network consists of a number of abtracted and hidden layers that filter the inputed data into some sort of output node/s, see the diagram above\n",
    "\n",
    "when the script is run and the train argument is passed the MNIST dataset is loaded into memory using:\n",
    "\n",
    ">(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entry / Convolutional Layer\n",
    "This is the initial entry layer, taking in an array of pixels, width and height and produces a tensor.  More info [here](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pooling Layer\n",
    "The purpose of this layer is to reduce computation in the neural net, info found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43453712/what-is-output-tensor-of-max-pooling-2d-layer-in-tensorflow) and [here](https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/content/pooling_layer.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropout Layer\n",
    "This layer is here to make sure that the network does not have an overy tailored fit to the training and test data.\n",
