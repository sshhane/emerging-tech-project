### Install Python
In order to run both the Jupyter Notebooks and the script you will first need to have python 3 installed.  [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is a link to download python.

### Install Jupyter
Additionally to run the notebooks you must install [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install).

The easiest way to get set up is to use Pythonâ€™s package manager, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install Jupyter.  [Here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) is some information on how to install pip if you havent already got it.

Now that we have python and pip, open up a terminal window or command prompt and run:

`python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`

and...

`python3 -m pip install jupyter`

And finally to run the notebook navigate to where you have downloaded this repo and run:

`jupyter notebook`
